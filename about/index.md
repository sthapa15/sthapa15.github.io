I'm Sukriti, a computer engineer with a focus on programming and design. I recently received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Virginia (UVA). Throughout my computer engineering years at UVA, I worked on a variety of projects from embedded system design to cloud computing and have yet to find my niche. 

Recently, I've discovered a passion for android app development and been enlightened by Don Norman's _The Design of Everyday Things_. I am passionate about the field of ever evolving technology. My creativity and curiousity pushes me to go after challenges, follow my dreams to reach my goals, and keeps my thirst for learning alive. I learn about world affairs, technology, and about myself everyday. Ultimately, as a first generation college graduate, I want to be an inspiration and role model to young women in the STEM field. I want to be an inspiration just as Sheryl Sandberg, Reshma Saujani, Grace Hopper, and others are to me. 

Outside of programming and learning new skills, I have a love for writing lyrical poetry (more along the lines of rap than shakespeare), playing video games old and new, airplanes, listening to music from the Beatles to Eminem, and watching Chopped with a side of Say Yes to the Dress. If I had all the money and time in the world, I would travel. I am in love with the exponential growth of technology and even wrote a small thesis on it (you can view it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vsqafq7l6jjqmma/FinalSTSThesis.pdf?dl=0)). I am fascinated by people and the role of technology in this era. Some day, I would like to be able to be in a position where I can support a STEM program in Nepal, my birth country. 

**Fun fact**: I got bit by a monkey in Nepal when I was 4.
