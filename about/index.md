####Hello!

I'm Sukriti, a computer engineer with a focus on programming and design. I recently received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Virginia (UVA). Throughout my computer engineering years at UVA, I worked on a variety of projects from embedded system design to cloud computing and have yet to find my niche.

Recently, I have discovered a passion for android app development and been enlightened by Don Norman's _The Design of Everyday Things_
