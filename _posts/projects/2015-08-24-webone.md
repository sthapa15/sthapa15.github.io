###Overview
 
This project serves as a place to display my projects, however it was mostly for practice. I created it in order to learn HTML and CSS, following Udacity's course on HTML and CSS. 

The website is built to be responsive so that all the content within it can display on all display sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile), including images. For the layout of the site, I utilized a grid based layout so that the body has an element that serves as a container for rows and columns on the page. 
 
The structre of the page (all contained in the index.html file) is entirely separate from the design/style of the page (all contained within the styles.css and bootstrap css files). Addtionally, HTML5 semantic tags are used for cleaner code organization. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/sthapa15/portfolio-page). 

Originally, I created my own layout and one css file for style/ design to understand the concepts of HTML and CSS. Afterwards, I implemented the Bootstrap framework and made use of the modal class to create modals for each "app" in the "Featured Work" section of the website.

Currently the information and images are placeholders (baby goats, one of my favorite animals!), while this website serves as my actual portfolio. 

The **demo** of the website is accesible at: [Suki Portfolio](http://sthapa15.github.io/portfolio-page/).
