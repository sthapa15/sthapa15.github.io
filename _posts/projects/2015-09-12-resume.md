####Overview

This project was completed in order to showcase the skills I learned from teaching myself the basics of JavaScript and jQuery with the help of Udacity courses. The resume is built by writing a JS script that combines my information with HTML and CSS templates to generate it. By building this resume, I gained an understanding of JavaScript syntax, including manipulating data types (JSON), building loops, and creating functions and built upon my previous HTML/CSS skills learned from the portfolio page project. Additionally, some simple jQuery DOM manipulation methods are used to build the resume the moment a user opens up the website. 

The **demo** of the website is accesible at: [Responsive Resume](http://sthapa15.github.io/responsive-resume/). 

You can view the code [here](https://github.com/sthapa15/responsive-resume.git).

####Process
The resume has four main sections: work, education, projects, and header which holds biographical information. 

1. Built four JSONs to represent the different sections of the resume.
2. Iterated through each JSON and appended its information to index.html in the correct section using jQuery functions.
3. Used JavaScript methods to input data for the resume JSONs.
4. Implemented a Google script element to add a map in the "Where I've Lived and Worked" section. 
5. Modified JS script to initialize the map and set fitBounds.
6. Created a function to console.log() information about click locations.
7. Created a description box to show up when you click on the location pins in the map.
