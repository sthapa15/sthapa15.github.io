This is to showcase the UVA Grounds Tour App, created with a team. It is an android app that allows you to take a scavenger hunt type tour of 
the most popular spots at the University of Virginia such as the Rotunda. Using the phone as a guide, the app will let you know if you have come close to
a tour stop or not. A map in app will be provided and the background color changes as one gets closer to any one of the destinations.
